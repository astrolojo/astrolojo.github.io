										<h2 class="major">Hello!</h2>
										<p>I am a postdoctoral fellow at <a href="https://www.stsci.edu/">STScI</a> (the Space Telescope Science Institute) in Baltimore, MD, where I work to understand the many roles that metals play in how galaxies formed and evolved. Originally from a small town in Arkansasâ€™s River Valley, I earned my B.S. in physics from <a href="https://physics.uark.edu/">the University of Arkansas</a> in 2016 and my Ph.D. in Astronomy from <a href="https://www.astro.wisc.edu/">the University of Wisconsin-Madison</a> in 2021.</p>

									<p> Although elements heavier than helium &#8211 metals &#8211 make up only about 1% of the baryons in the Universe, they drive many of the most complicated processes and unsolved mysteries in astrophysics. As stellar generations come and go, the flow of metals between gas and stars fundamentally connects their physical properties. This means that understanding the birth and buildup of galaxies requires that we understand how these two components evolve and chemically influence each other. I use multi-wavelength observations (especially spectroscopy) of stars, atomic gas, and molecular gas to aid in this quest for metal.

											<h3 class="major">Extragalactic Star Clusters</h3>
											<p>Measuring the metallicity of stars gives a different view on the past life of galaxies than looking at ionized gas. I wrote a Python code for Simultaneous Estimates of Star-cluster Age, Metallicity, Mass, and Extinction (SESAMME), which you can read more about by following the button below. I use SESAMME and other tools to understand how fast metals are recycled into new star clusters, based on spectroscopy in the optical and ultraviolet toward relatively nearby galaxies. </p>

											<h3 class="major">CO-Dark Molecular Gas</h3>
											<p> Astronomers often use carbon monoxide (CO) as a proxy for molecular hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) &#8211 the fuel for imminent star formation, which is (historically) hard to observe. But CO often leaves out part of the story. Galaxies with low metallicity often have little dust and greater ultraviolet power from their stars, which destroys CO much more easily than H<sub>2</sub>. In such galaxies, CO may make up only a tiny fraction of the total amount of molecular gas they contain. I use data from <a href="https://www.stsci.edu/jwst/">JWST</a>, <a href="https://almascience.nrao.edu/">ALMA</a>, and other facilities to understand what makes some molecular gas "CO-dark." </p>

										<h2 class="major">Teaching, Mentoring, and Public Engagement</h2>
										<p>As a graduate student and postdoc, I have worked with several undergraduate students across different institutions in a mentor-mentee relationship. I enjoy working with students to develop and carry out research projects that can give them experience in doing "real-world" science and which may lead to a senior thesis or even a published scientific paper. You can learn more about my mentoring style by looking at my mentoring agreement (and why I believe in mentoring agreements via the resources hosted by the <a href="https://nrmnet.net/">National Research Mentoring Network</a>). </p>
